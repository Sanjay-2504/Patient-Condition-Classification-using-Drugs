# Patient-Condition-Classification-using-Drugs

Objective:
The project aims to classify patient's condition based on the reviews provided.
The objective of this project is to classify patient reviews related to specific conditions, namely Depression, High Blood Pressure, and Type 2 Diabetes.

•	The data was cleaned by removing stop words and performing normalization, and the date feature was excluded as it was deemed unhelpful for building the model.
•	To convert the review text into numerical data, the TF-IDF vectorizer was used and several models including Logistic Regression, Random Forest, KNN, SVM, Passive Aggressive Classifier and Decision Tree were constructed
•	using the patient's condition as the dependent variable and the review as the independent variable.
•	The Random Forest model was selected as the best model based on the evaluation metrics, which demonstrated its superior accuracy.
•	The project also recommended 3 popular drugs based on their ratings; however, it was noted that individual drug effects may vary, and the recommendations should be considered general in nature.

Conclusion:
The project successfully predicted patient conditions based on drug reviews, and the insights gained can be used to recommend suitable drugs for patients based on their condition 
and the experiences of other patients with similar conditions. The project's findings provide valuable information to healthcare providers and patients alike in making informed decisions regarding drug usage.
